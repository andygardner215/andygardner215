 I'm andygardner
I’m trying to solve a problem which I currently have with a Sainsmart Genmitsu PROVerXL3040 CNC router which I have recently extended to 60x60. 
I'm trying to resolve a problem with the grbl software as the machine is tripping out in the Jog mode, particularly when jogging with the X axis and I'm not able to home the machine.
Has anyone had similar issues with their CNC machines? My knowledge of grbl is near zero, apart from knowing how to use $$ to access the grbl list of commands to change the dimensions of cutting area, though this is possibly where my problems began.
